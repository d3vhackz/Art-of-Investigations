# What Makes a Great Investigation

Not all investigations are good. It can be a cause of many factors like a lack time, experience, or awareness. Rregardless of the reason, you should always have one objective in mind: **Understand exactly what happened, backed with evidence and conclude if the activity was malicious or benign.** The reality is analysts only understand 70-80% of the activity due to lack of data source and/or the analyst expertise and conclude "most likely this is what happened". You should always have proof of something happening. For example, if there was a brute force attack, take a screenshot of what account was attacked and any failed logon attempts that you can find. In short, if you can't back up your statement with evidence, don't write it down.

Things to consider:
- Build a story that clearly atates what happened along with supporting evidence
  - Screenshots, Timeline, Logs
 - Provide details within the investigation that are relevant to the alert and the actions performed
 - Answers questions that the recipient might have
 - Provides recommendations and next steps
 - Conclusion
