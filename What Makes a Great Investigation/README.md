# What Makes a Great Investigation

A great investigation doesn’t happen by accident—it’s the result of deliberate analysis, effective communication, and evidence-driven conclusions. Not all investigations are equally valuable. Common pitfalls include lack of time, limited experience, poor data visibility, or failure to follow a structured process. Despite these challenges, every investigation should aim for one clear objective:

> **Understand exactly what happened, back it with solid evidence, and determine whether the activity was malicious or benign.**

## The Reality of Uncertainty

In most real-world cases, analysts rarely have full visibility. Due to missing telemetry or limited analyst expertise, it's common to reach only a **70–80% level of confidence**. As a result, many conclusions will be framed as:

> *“Most likely, this is what happened…”*

And that’s okay—**as long as your claims are grounded in observable data.** If you can’t prove something, **don’t include it in your report.** Always strive to capture artifacts such as:

- Screenshots of relevant evidence  
- Logs confirming activity  
- Timestamps tied to key actions  
- Specific accounts or systems involved

## Key Components of a Great Investigation

### Narrative Clarity
- Build a compelling, logical story around what happened.  
- Create a timeline that maps out the sequence of events.  
- Use visuals (screenshots, logs, etc.) to reinforce your findings.

### Relevance and Focus
- Include only details directly tied to the alert or suspicious activity.  
- Eliminate unnecessary technical noise or speculation.

### Anticipate Questions
Ask yourself:
- What happened?  
- When and where did it happen?  
- How was it detected?  
- What systems or users were involved?  
- What was the impact?

### Actionable Recommendations
- Suggest next steps (e.g., block an IP, reset a password, tune a detection rule).  
- Tailor advice based on the type and scope of activity.

### Clear Conclusion
- Determine whether the activity was **malicious**, **benign**, or **inconclusive**.  
- Include your **confidence level** and **justify it with evidence**.

- [ ] Have I answered likely questions from other analysts or stakeholders?  
- [ ] Did I provide actionable next steps?  
- [ ] Is my conclusion clear, justified, and supported by evidence?
